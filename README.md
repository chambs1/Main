INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE:

Step 1: Launch the executable file.
Step 2: You will be prompted to enter the customer name.  Type in the customer name: first name and last name separated by a space, then press enter. How you type in the customer name is exactly as it will appear on the printout. At any time in this step of the program you can type in a     ‘Q’ character and the program will promptly dismiss.
Step 3: Once you’ve entered the customer name, you will be prompted to enter the number of items ordered. Enter a number between 1 and 24. If you enter a number outside of these parameters, the program will re-prompt you to enter a valid number of items. Additionally, if you enter a         combination of letters or other non-number characters, the program will re-prompt you to enter only numbers.
Step 4: The program now repeats itself and returns to Step 2.  You can enter as many customer names and number of items as you wish.
